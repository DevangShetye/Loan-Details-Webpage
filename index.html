                <h3>Unsecured personal loans</h3>
                <p>Personal loans are used for a variety of reasons, from paying for wedding expenses to consolidating debt. Personal loans can be unsecured loans, which means you’re not putting collateral like a home or car on the line in case you default
                    on your loan.</p>

                <h3>Payday alternative loans</h3>
                <p>A payday alternative loan is a short-term loan offered by some federal credit unions. A PAL is designed to be more affordable than a payday loan. Payday alternative loan amounts range from $200 to $1,000, and they have longer repayment
                    terms than payday loans — one to six months instead of the typical few weeks you get with a payday loan.</p>

                <h3> Home equity loans</h3>
                <p>A home equity loan is a type of secured loan where your home is used as collateral to borrow a lump sum of money. The amount you can borrow is based on the equity you have in your home, or the difference between your home’s market value
                    and how much you owe on your home. You typically can’t borrow more than 85% of the equity you have in your home.</p>

                <h3> Credit card cash advances</h3>
                <p>Even though you’re using your credit card, you won’t necessarily have the same interest rate on a cash advance as a normal purchase. You may begin accruing interest as soon as you withdraw the money — and you’ll likely face a processing
                    fee.

                <h3>Secured personal loans</h3>
                <p>Secured personal loans often come with lower interest rates than unsecured personal loans. That’s because the lender may consider a secured loan to be less risky — there’s an asset backing up your loan. If you don’t mind pledging collateral
                    and you’re confident you can pay back your loan, a secured loan may help you save money on interest.</p>

                <h3>Payday loans</h3>
                <p>Payday loans are short-term, high-cost loans that are typically due by your next payday. States regulate payday lenders differently, which means your available loan amount, loan fees and the time you have to repay may vary based on where
                    you live. And some states ban payday lending altogether.</p>

                <h3>Title loans</h3>
                <p>If you own your car, you may be able to take out a car title loan. You can typically borrow between 25% and 50% of your car’s value. Title loan amounts often range from $100 to $5,500, according to the Federal Trade Commission, and you’ll
                    usually have to repay your title loan within 15 to 30 days. If you don’t, your car could be repossessed.</p>
